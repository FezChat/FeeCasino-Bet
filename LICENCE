## Important Notes

1. **This is a complete mock application** - All money is fake, all transactions are simulated
2. **Supabase integration** - Uses the provided Supabase project for data storage
3. **Aviator game** - Fully functional with realistic mechanics
4. **Multi-currency support** - Detects user locale and supports 50+ currencies
5. **Responsive design** - Works on desktop and mobile devices
6. **Sound effects** - Browser-based sounds with fallback
7. **Complete UI/UX** - Looks and feels like a commercial betting app

## To Run the Application:

1. Save all files in the described structure
2. Run the SQL schema in your Supabase project
3. Update the Supabase URL and key in the API files if needed
4. Open `index.html` in a modern web browser
5. The app will work even without Supabase (fallback to localStorage)

**Remember**: This is for demonstration/entertainment only. Never use for real money gambling.
